## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
My favorite applications and features that make them my favorite app:
1. Instagram
   * option for a dark theme or light theme
   * caters to me
   * chat features for individual or groups
3. Discord
   * option for a dark theme or light theme
   * chat features for individuals or groups
   * option to change names for different servers
5. Youtube
   * option for a dark theme or light theme
   * comments section
   * recommended videos 
7. Tiktok:
   * versatile
   * caters to me
   * direct message option
9. Call of Duty: Mobile
    * has a set orientation
    * easy navigation
    * sound when clicking buttons

App Idea: Travel Activities App where it shows activities within the selected area. It would have a description, the location on a map, price, and reviews. The app would have an option for a dark theme or light theme, anonymous chat features, and recommended places based on recent/ previous history. 

## Notes

New to Swift, I struggled with implementing the "change background" color onto the storyboard. To resolve this issue, I referenced the instructions again and sought support via Slack until it was fixed and completed.
